# Basic Machine Learning
The goal of training a basic ML is to find the optimal values for these weights and biases that minimize loss function. The iteration process involves repeatedly computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the model's parameters (weights and biases) and adjusting them accordingly. During each iteration, the weights and biases are updated based on the computed learning rate. The iterative process continues until reaching a maximum number of iterations (epoch) of convergence. At the end of the training process, the final values of the weights and biases represent the learned parameters of the model.
